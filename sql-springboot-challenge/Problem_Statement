Problem Statement:
Find the highest salary that was credited to an employee, but only for transactions that were not 
made on the 1st day of any month. Along with the salary, you are also required to extract the 
employee data like name (combine first name and last name into one column), age and 
department who received this salary

SELECT p.AMOUNT AS SALARY,
 CONCAT(e.FIRST_NAME, ' ', e.LAST_NAME) AS NAME,
 TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, e.DOB, CURDATE()) AS AGE,
 d.DEPARTMENT_NAME 
FROM PAYMENTS p 
JOIN EMPLOYEE e ON p.EMP_ID = e.EMP_ID 
JOIN DEPARTMENT d ON e.DEPARTMENT = d.DEPARTMENT_ID 
WHERE DAY(p.PAYMENT_TIME) != 1 
ORDER BY p.AMOUNT DESC 
LIMIT 1;
