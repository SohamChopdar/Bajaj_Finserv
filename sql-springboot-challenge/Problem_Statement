count of employees in the same department whose age is less than theirs.

SELECT p.AMOUNT AS SALARY,
 CONCAT(e.FIRST_NAME, ' ', e.LAST_NAME) AS NAME,
 TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, e.DOB, CURDATE()) AS AGE,
 d.DEPARTMENT_NAME 
FROM PAYMENTS p 
JOIN EMPLOYEE e ON p.EMP_ID = e.EMP_ID 
JOIN DEPARTMENT d ON e.DEPARTMENT = d.DEPARTMENT_ID 
WHERE DAY(p.PAYMENT_TIME) != 1 
ORDER BY p.AMOUNT DESC 
LIMIT 1;
